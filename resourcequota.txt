----------------------------Resource Quotas-------------------------------
When several users or teams share a cluster with a fixed number of nodes, 
there is a concern that one team could use more than its fair share of resources.

A resource quota, defined by a ResourceQuota object, provides constraints that limit aggregate resource consumption per namespace.
It can limit the quantity of objects that can be created in a namespace by type, 
as well as the total amount of compute resources that may be consumed by resources in that namespace.


-------------Enabling Resource Quota--------------------------
Resource Quota support is enabled by default for many Kubernetes distributions. 
It is enabled when the API server --enable-admission-plugins= flag has ResourceQuota as one of its arguments.

A resource quota is enforced in a particular namespace when there is a ResourceQuota in that namespace.
